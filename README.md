🏡 Home Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict house prices based on various features using regression techniques. This notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using popular regression algorithms.

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to:
	•	Understand the relationship between housing features and price.
	•	Build regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict house prices.
	•	Perform EDA and visualize correlations.
	•	Apply data preprocessing techniques like handling missing values and encoding.
	•	Use GridSearchCV for model optimization.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains various features such as:
	•	Location
	•	Size (BHK)
	•	Square Footage
	•	Number of Bathrooms
	•	Price

Note: This dataset may be either a custom dataset or sourced from platforms like Kaggle or a local real estate agency.

📊 Tools and Libraries Used
	•	Python 🐍
	•	NumPy, Pandas
	•	Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA & visualization)
	•	Scikit-learn (for ML models & preprocessing)
	•	Jupyter Notebook

⚙️ Model Workflow
	1.	Data Cleaning – Remove/handle null values, duplicates.
	2.	Feature Engineering – Convert categorical to numerical, outlier removal.
	3.	Exploratory Data Analysis – Plotting correlations, distributions.
	4.	Model Training – Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
	5.	Evaluation – RMSE, R² Score.
	6.	Hyperparameter Tuning – GridSearchCV for optimal parameters.

📈 Results
	•	Best performing model: (e.g., Random Forest Regressor)
	•	Accuracy (R² Score): 96%
